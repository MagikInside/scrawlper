Scrawlper
========

In this very small project, I used the Web-Crawler [node-crawler](https://github.com/sylvinus/node-crawler) to crawl and scrap a job portal, [infojobs](http://www.infojobs.net/), to check this tool and extract some info into a json file.

Then I used this info, about job offers, to another small project using MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angularjs and Nodejs), that you can check out in [hyperion](https://github.com/MagikInside/hyperion)

## How to use

1. Clone the project
2. Install dependencies
3. Start
